This repository contains a simple C program that illustrates a subtle issue with the post-increment operator. The program initializes an integer variable `x` to 10 and then prints its value twice using `printf`. The first print statement uses the post-increment operator (`x++`), while the second statement prints the value of `x` after the increment. The unexpected behavior arises from the order of operations involved in the post-increment operator: the value of `x` is used before the increment takes place.  The solution demonstrates how to achieve the expected behavior.
